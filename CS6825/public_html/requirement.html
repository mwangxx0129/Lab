                    <li>(50 points) <strong>Proposal: </strong>Adequately given proposal posted on time on discussion board. </li>
            
                    <li>(10 points) <b>Format&amp; Ease of Use: </b>You must implement the tutorial as a web 
            
                        tutorial. That means HTML/CSS with supporting media.
                        <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Navigation should be easy. </li>
                            <li>Look 
                            
                            and Feel appropriate and engaging. </li>
                            <li>It should also not take too long 
                            
                            to load pages. </li>
                            <li>You should post your on-line tutorial to your 
                        
                        server account. You are responsible for fully testing your tutorial.
                            </li>
                            <li>Tip: You must create a public_html directory in your puzzle login directory and the login directory and public_html directory must be filemode 755. All your content must be placed under the public_html directory. You can use any tool like WinSCP, SSH client or Putty that support SSH protocol for secure file transfer. <span class="RedHighlight">If you do not know how to do this or how to make HTML pages, you need to come to office hours prior by April 30 to understand this....this is your responsibility.</span></li>
                            <li>Tip: think about using thumbnail images, and other techniques 
                            
                            to allow users to be able to get the idea without having to wait for 
                            
                            a long time and yet allow them to view the images in more detail if 
                            
                            desired.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>(10 points) <b>Mixed-Media: </b>You must have a minimum of 5 pictures 
            
                        or diagrams illustrating the concept you are discussing. As appropriate 
            
                        include video or audio also. If you borrow images, you must reference 
            
                    in the legend where you retrieved them from. You must add voice to each of your individual web pages (not necessary for pages that only show blow-ups of images).        </li>
                    <li>(10 points) <b>Organization: </b>The tutorial should be organized. 
            
                        It SHOULD not look like a long paper simply poped-up on the web. You 
            
                        should have a nice intro page with an easy navigation scheme present 
            
                    throughout the site's pages.        </li>
            
                    <li>(20 points) <b>Originality: </b>Your writing should be original. You 
            
                        can NOT paraphrase large blocks of text. If you need to paraphrase smaller 
            
                        items, you need to refer to the article in which the text comes from 
            
                        and surround the text with quotes. You should keep to a bare minimum 
            
                    the number of times you paraphrase others words.        </li>
                    <li>(20 points) <b>Length: </b>Someone should be able to complete the tutorial 
            
                    within 30 minutes, and it should minimally take 15 minutes unassisted.        </li>
                    <li>(10 points) <b>Grammar: </b>good grammar</li>
                    <li>(60 points) <b>Level of Detail:</b> This is a graduate level course 
            
                        and as such, I expect that you will delve into your topic at a sufficient 
            
                        level of detail for the audience to be able to understand how things 
            
                        are implemented or created and with possible reference to other articles 
            
                        (that you quote) be able to recreate or build the system(s) described.  Includes <strong>Detail -overall (summary of concepts, results given--how well works) , Detail- tech algorithms/system details,  Detail -applications discussed. Detail-limitations of system discussed</strong>.  
            
                        For example
                        <ul>
            
                        <li>If you are discussing a topic that involves the development of 
            
                            software or algorithms, you should present a minimum of one algorithm 
            
                            or piece of code on the topic. You should discuss how the algorithm 
            
                            works and if there are alternatives compare them to others, summarizing 
            
                            with what you think (and others may think) are superior algorithms 
            
                            (and why). Also, give the user an idea when you might apply one 
            
                            technique over another.</li>
            
                        <li>If you are discussing a topic that is hardware-based, you should 
            
                            discuss the various hardware options, the components of the hardware 
            
                            system(s), how the hardware works, the conditions under which the 
            
                            hardware system(s) should be used, the output format of the hardware. 
            
                            Discuss the limitations of the hardware and assumptions made about 
            
                            the working environment. Contrast and compare different hardware 
            
                            system(s) that may accomplish the same or similar (or different 
            
                            if appropriate) goals.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
            
                    <li>(10 points) <strong>Interactivity</strong>: You are to incorporate some kind of interactive activity - either a test/ quiz (you don't have to grade it) or some kind of special video of a demonstration (you create) or a slide show (you create) ,etc.        </li>
                    <li>(10 points) <b>Annotated Bibliography</b>:&nbsp;You are required to 
            
                        have links in your on-line (or powerpoint) tutorial to an annotated bibliography. You 
            
                        must have a minimum of 5 different references (please note different 
            
                        pages on the same web-site do NOT count). Throughout your on-line tutorial, 
            
                        each time you wish to quote a reference, it should be represented by 
            
                        a number that is hyper-text linked to the annotated bibliography. In 
            
                        this bibliography page, you will have listed in order of appearance 
            
                        (hence the numbers) your references each followed by an annotation of 
            
                        the contents of the reference. Specifically, you must include not only 
            
                        the title, author, date, source, but also, a sysnopsis, and a reliability 
            
                    rating. For example, for the second reference you would have:
